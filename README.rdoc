This is a web app built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSql.

The goal of the app is for users to be able to log in/register, add new events, comment on events, join events, and unjoin events. Users can see all events they have joined, as well as those that they haven't. They can also see who created the events, and when they are occuring.
